Energy can not be created or destroyed, only change form.|Heat does not conduct from a colder object to a warmer object by itself.|The entropy within a system approch its constant minimum when the temperature approach absolute zero.|If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
